# app 만들기

My environment: macOS / Flutter
My development targets are iOS, Android, and Web.

My first goal is to build the main screen UI to match the design shown in /targetUI/mainscreen.png.

Set the main screen image to /assets/mainScreenImg.jpeg.

Create a bottom navigation bar with the following buttons, but do not link them yet—just create the buttons:

Home: MainScreen

Calendar: non-link

Pomodoro: non-link

Planner: non-link

Dict: non-link

Leave the Daily Schedule section empty for now.
